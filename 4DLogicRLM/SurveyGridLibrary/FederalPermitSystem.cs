     * For the purposes of these Regulations, Canada lands shall be divided into grid areas.

5 (1) A grid area, the whole or greater part of which lies south of latitude 70°, shall be bounded on the east and west sides by successive meridians of longitude of the series 50°00′00″, 50°15′00″, 50°30′00″, which series may be extended as required, and on the north and south sides by straight lines joining the points of intersection of the east and west boundaries with successive parallels of latitude of the series 40°00′00″, 40°10′00″, 40°20′00″, which series may be extended as required.

(2) A grid area, the whole of which lies north of latitude 70°, shall be bounded on the east and west sides by successive meridians of longitude of the series 50°00′00″, 50°30′00″, 51°00′00″, which series may be extended as required and on the north and south sides by straight lines joining the points of intersection of the east and west boundaries with successive parallels of latitude of the series 70°00′00″, 70°10′00″, 70°20′00″, which series may be extended as required.

(3) Every grid area shall be referred to by the latitude and longitude of the northeast corner of that grid area.

6 (1) Between latitudes 40° and 60° and between latitudes 70° and 75° the boundary

(a) between the north and south halves of a grid area is the north boundary of sections 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85 and 95; and

(b) between the east and west halves of a grid area is the west boundary of sections 41 to 50.

(2) Between latitudes 60° and 68° and between latitudes 75° and 78° the boundary

(a) between the north and south halves of a grid area is the north boundary of sections 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65 and 75; and

(b) between the east and west halves of a grid area is the west boundary of sections 31 to 40.

(3) Between latitudes 68° and 70° and between latitudes 78° and 85° the boundary

(a) between the north and south halves of a grid area is the north boundary of sections 5, 15, 25, 35, 45 and 55; and

(b) between the east and west halves of a grid area is the west boundary of sections 21 to 30.

7 (1) Every grid area shall be divided into sections.

(2) A section shall be bounded on the east and west sides by meridians spaced,

(a) in the case of a section within a grid area, the whole or greater part of which lies between latitudes 40° and 60° or between latitudes 70° and 75°, at intervals of one-tenth of the interval between the east and west boundaries of the grid area;

(b) in the case of a section within a grid area, the whole or greater part of which lies between latitudes 60° and 68° or between latitudes 75° and 78°, at intervals of one-eighth of the interval between the east and west boundaries of the grid area; and

(c) in the case of a section within a grid area, the whole or greater part of which lies between latitudes 68° and 70° or between latitudes 78° and 85°, at intervals of one-sixth of the interval between the east and west boundaries of the grid area.

(3) A section shall be bounded on the north and south sides by straight lines drawn parallel to the north and south boundaries of the grid area and spaced at intervals of one-tenth of the interval between the north and south boundaries of the grid area.


        All latitudes and longitudes used in these Regulations shall be referred to the North American Datum of 1927.
